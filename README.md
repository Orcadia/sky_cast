<p align="left">This aim of this school project was to introduce me to Android application development using Flutter framework.<br>This project was done in team of three and we choose to make SkyCast because we want to make an app for METAR.<br>Figma was used to make the model of the app. Then we used Android Studio to make the app.<br>Docker was used on a Raspberry Pi 4 to host AVWX API. All the setup was done by me because I have already used this API to parse it in C++.</p>

If you want to install this app on your smartphone you can clone this repo but you'll need more step to have it fully working.<br><br>To have the API in local follow this link to setting it up on [Docker](https://github.com/avwx-rest/avwx-api) or check the [website](https://info.avwx.rest/) to use her solution
